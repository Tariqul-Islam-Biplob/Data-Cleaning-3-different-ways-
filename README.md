## üìÑ CSV Data Cleaning 

This repository showcases **three different methods** to clean and preprocess a raw CSV dataset using:

*  **Python (Pandas)**
*  **Power BI (Power Query Editor)**
*  **SQL (PostgreSQL)**

### Objective:

To demonstrate how the same data cleaning task can be accomplished across different tools and platforms commonly used in data analytics.

###  Tasks Performed:

* Handling missing/null values
* Removing duplicates
* Standardizing categorical values (e.g., replacing "Yes"/"No" with "Y"/"N")
* Cleaning text fields (e.g., removing special characters, trimming spaces)
* Formatting columns (e.g., proper casing, renaming)
* Converting data types

### üìÅ Structure:

* `python data cleaninin.pinyb: Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step Python (Pandas) cleaning
* `powerbi_cleaning.pbix`: Power BI project file using Power Query Editor
* `sql_cleaning.sql`: SQL script for cleaning data directly in PostgreSQL

###  Why This Matters:

Data rarely comes clean. Knowing how to clean and prepare data across various tools is essential for any data professional. This project illustrates practical, real-world examples of cleaning data using different approaches to suit different workflows.
